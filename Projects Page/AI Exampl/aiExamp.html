            <p>During the first weeks we have studied different applications and real-life situations that apply to the User Experience. As for assignmets 1 and 2 we had to do some research on a few AI examples and find a few positive and negative aspects. Moreover, we had to write down a few aspects about our favorite apps that we use on a daily basis.</p>

            <div class="week1">
                <h2>Assignment Week 1</h2>

                <h3>Google Maps - AI Route</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using Google Maps is crucial to me as a person who never lived in Eindhoven. The program uses AI to calculate the fastest route based on an algorithm. It also takes the traffic into account, so your travel can be much faster, depending if you choose its suggestions.</li><br />
                    <li>The downside to this, is its limited ability to handle certain problems. I have encountered this multiple times – the program changes the route a lot of times, gets “lost” in the city and doesn’t always calculate the time correctly. The biggest flaw of this system is its requirement to constantly track user localization, even if the app is not being used. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="week2">
                <h2>Assignment Week 2</h2>
                <img src="fav-app.jpg" height="250" width="500"/>
                <h3>Favourite App - Google Maps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Minimalism</b> It provides the user with only the necessary information. It requires you only your current location, which is done automatically if Location is turned on, and your destination. Moreover, it uses intuitive icons to choose from based on the way you want to travel, by car, by public transportation, by foot etc. Besides, it also shows in small boxes the length and the approximate time as well as alternative routes.</li><br />
                    <li><b>Freedom</b> Maps also lets you, as mentioned before, choose between which way you’d like to travel. As well as that, you can add as many destinations as you’d want to and those don’t even need to be well known places, such as restaurants, banks etc., but only places you’d like to travel to or need to read, such as a house or an apartment.</li>
