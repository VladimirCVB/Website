                <p>During Weeks 3, 4 and 5 we had to make a survey concerning people's perception on a specific application. We have chosen to have a look over Google Maps. Our approach was as follows: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check the age of our users</li>
                    <li>Check which means of transport they use</li>
                    <li>Create Personas</li>
                    <li>See when/how they use Google Maps</li>
                    <li>See how satisfied are they</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="personas">
                <h2>Personas</h2>

                <p>In oreder to gain more information and to have a better look over what Google Maps has to offer we have decided to create personas.</p>

                    <p>As a result of the survey we have discovered that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represents not satisfied at all, and 5 represents very satisfied</li>
                        <li>10 out of 13 users were very satisfied</li>
                        <li>Sometimes the routes and places are not accurate.</li>

                        <li>Most of users questioned use it to travel within city limits and for their daily commute</li>
                        <li>The majority of surveyed users find the information provided by Google Maps useful and accurate</li>
                        <li>We also wanted to find out if our users use voice assistance, most users (70%) donâ€™t use it</li>
                        <li>When asked for feedback, users reported inaccurate routes and estimated times and using too much data</li>

                        <li>Most of surveyed users live in a city with a population of less than 500k and the rest live in big cities with 1M+ people</li>
                        <li>The majority of users reported the timetables being somewhat accurate at ~86% and remaining ~14% reported the timetables being accurate</li>
